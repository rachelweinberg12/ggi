title: "AI and Cybersecurity: The Big Picture"
---

AI is expected to have enormous impact on cybersecurity. However, it is difficult to form a coherent picture of what that impact will look like. AI capabilities are advancing rapidly; news stories are often sensationalized; the relative impact on offense vs. defense is widely debated; comprehensive data is generally not available.

In this site, we present a big-picture, long-term view of how the cybersecurity landscape will evolve in the AI era, incorporating technical, business, and policy considerations. For decision-makers, we present key ideas in accessible language without dumbing down. For AI or cybersecurity professionals, we tie these ideas to technical analysis.

This is an early, partial draft of a report by the [Golden Gate Institute for AI](https://www.goldengateinstitute.org/) in collaboration with [Carey Nachenberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carey-nachenberg-14bbb03/) and a panel of cybersecurity experts, including Adam Arellano, Cory Hardman, Daniel Kang, Eric Chien, Eugene Spafford, and Krystal Jackson. We are grateful to the panel for their contributions.

# The Cybersecurity Equilibrium

The impact of AI on cyberattacks is often viewed through a simple lens: if AI automates some aspect of cyberattacks, obviously there will be many more successful attacks.

This is unrealistic. Like any system involving multiple participants with competing interests, cybersecurity exists in a complex **equilibrium**. As a result, automation of a particular capability might not lead to a large increase in successful attacks. For instance, some attackers might be limited by the fear of retaliation, rather than an inability to scale up their operations.

To understand how advances in AI capabilities will impact the lived experience of cyberattacks, it’s important to understand this equilibrium. On this page, we review the important mechanisms of the cybersecurity equilibrium, some asymmetries between attack and defense, and implications for how various AI capabilities might tip the balance. **We conclude with a simple framework for estimating the impact of AI progress on the volume and impact of cyberattacks**.

# AI Capability Levels

In this page, we step back from the daily barrage of incremental advances in AI benchmark scores. We identify major milestones that will unlock sea changes in the cybersecurity equilibrium. These milestones cover both technical skills, and broader agentic capabilities that will allow AI to assist with the non-technical aspects of an attack (such as money laundering).

# Attack Chain Analysis

This section of the report is an analysis of how current and future AIs will impact the volume of cybersecurity attacks. There are many different sorts of cyberattacks, involving different goals and techniques. We consider a series of attack scenarios. For each, we list the steps involved in an attack, and apply the methodology described in [The Cybersecurity Equilibrium](https://www.notion.so/The-Cybersecurity-Equilibrium-1274c916374a80e0a1cbee90308d4cd1?pvs=21) to forecast how AI is likely to impact that form of attack.

# Next Steps + How You Can Help

Ultimately, we would like to present:

- Multiple overviews of how AI may affect cybersecurity in the coming years, targeted at different audiences such as CISOs, policymakers, and decision makers at AI labs and safety organizations.
- Deeper dives into topics ranging from “how CISOs should prioritize resources” to “where tipping points in cyberattack volumes might occur” to “promising agendas for reducing risk”.

Getting there will require legwork, such as extending our attack chain analysis to cover more scenarios. It will also require feedback and contributions from the community. We’re currently evaluating whether and how to proceed with this project; next steps will depend on the level of interest and feedback that we receive.
