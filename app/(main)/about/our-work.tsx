        <p className="mb-2">
          AI will transform the world at an unprecedented pace. Developments are
          happening so fast that it's hard to keep up: there's a constant
          cascade of contradictory predictions and competing policy proposals.
          Meanwhile, the communities shaping AI's future — industry leaders,
          safety researchers, security experts, civil society groups,
          policymakers, and academics — work in parallel, with too few avenues
          for candid discussion and collaboration.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          The Golden Gate Institute for AI is a think tank dedicated to
          addressing the most critical challenges of the transition to a world
          with powerful AI. We envision a future where institutions and experts
          across domains collaborate with urgency and humility to meet these
          oncoming challenges and opportunities, promoting security, democracy,
          and shared prosperity.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Our mission is to support leaders as they navigate this high-stakes
          period by bridging disciplines, convening experts, and publishing
          accessible analysis of AI’s toughest questions. When conflicting
          perspectives emerge on crucial questions, we serve as the organization
          you can turn to for clarity and insight.
        </p>
        <h2 className="my-4">Our approach</h2>
        <p className="mb-2">We focus on two complementary activies:</p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          <b>Convenings:</b> We bring together people with diverse viewpoints
          and expertise to engage in productive dialogue. Building on the
          success of The Curve conference, we create environments where AI labs,
          policymakers, researchers, and industry leaders can move beyond
          polarized debates to find common ground and develop nuanced
          perspectives.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          <b>Accessible analysis:</b> We take complex ideas circulating within
          the AI community, identify key points of agreement and disagreement,
          and present a synthesis for a broad audience without
          oversimplification. Through our publication Second Thoughts, we offer
          timely, thoughtful analysis that helps leaders make sense of AI
          developments.
