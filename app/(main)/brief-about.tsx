            We expect AI to be transformative, with the potential for enormous
            upside and downside, but don't think society is on track to make the
            most of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our mission is to support leaders as they navigate this high-stakes
            period of rapid AI advancement by bridging disciplines, convening
            experts, and publishing accessible analysis of AIâ€™s toughest
            questions. When conflicting perspectives emerge on crucial
            questions, we serve as the organization you can turn to for clarity
            and insight.
          </p>
          <p>We focus on four broad topics:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Timelines & Capabilities:</b> How quickly will AI development
              advance?
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Economic Impacts:</b> How quickly will AI be adopted, and what
              impact will this have on the economy? How can we ensure AI creates
              broad-based economic benefits?
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Democracy & Governance:</b> How must democratic and other key
              institutions adapt to the challenges and opportunities that AI
              brings?
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Realizing Benefits:</b> What can we do to unlock and facilitate
              adoption of beneficial uses of AI?
            </li>
          </ul>
